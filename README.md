# Libra wallet demo
Currently, FB doesn't provide full APIs to implement web-wallet, thus we use
Libra CLI running on server + service to map client web-requests to CLI commands.

## Project setup
```
npm install
```

### Compiles and hot-reloads for development
```
npm run serve
```

### Compiles and minifies for production
```
npm run build
```

### Customize configuration
See [Configuration Reference](https://cli.vuejs.org/config/).
